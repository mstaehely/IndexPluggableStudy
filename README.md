# Index Pluggable Study
By: Madeline Wessels, Jasper Hugunin, Matthew Staehely

A case study being performed on the Index Checker pluggable tool, from a programmer's perspective.
This case study is looking to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the index checker tool, with
respect to defect prevention and time saved or spent using the annotation system provided by the tool.

The case study will be performed on two separate codebases. The first is the Joda-Time codebase, located
at https:www.github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time. The second codebase will be the Google Collections framework,
referred to as Guava. These codebases will be annotated using the Index Checker to analyze the ease of 
use of the index checker on already existing, well-documented, and useable sets of code. We will determine
this by the number of annotations we perform, as well as the difficulty in inserting those annotations such
that the checker runs without error. We are not attempting to demonstrate the soundness of the checker.
